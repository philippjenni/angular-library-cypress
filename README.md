# Known Issues

* Coverage does not work if the name cypress is present in the path. Check out the project in the `angular-library-cy` folder.
* Error Message `ERROR in error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'cypress'.` when running Library tests. But Coverage and Test works fine. Must be an confiuration issue.
